      Mrs.Sruthi adopted this dog from us 2years ago. She was all alone during
      the lockdown and felt that she found a perfect companion in the dog to
      regulate her stress and anxiety during the hard times.

      Mr.Ragunath being a retired army officer adopted this dog 5 years ago. He
      expressed that this dog was a good companion and made up for the boredom
      of him as he was very playful and sometimes even naughty as a grandchild.

      Mr and Mrs Verma adopted a pug 7 years ago. According to Mrs.Verma
      <u
        >"We felt very lifeless during the time we were having a difficulty to
        give birth to a child. This pug was a sigh of relief and become a good
        companion in my life".</u

      Being a student, Ms.shabana felt lonely during her studies abroad so she
      adopted a pet cat 3 years. This cat was taken care of before adoption as
      it was an infected stray cat. Knowing this she took good care of the cat
      and the both immediately became good friends and she found a good
      companion while she was away from her family.
