       Mr and Mrs Verma adopted a pug 7 years ago. According to Mrs.Verma <u>"We felt very lifeless during the time we were having a difficulty to give birth to a child. This pug was a sigh of relief and become a good companion in my life".</u>

    <p> Being a student, Ms.shabana felt lonely during her studies abroad so she adopted a pet cat 3 years. This cat was taken care of before adoption as it was an infected stray cat. Knowing this she took good care of the cat and the both immediately became good friends and she found a good companion while she was away from her family.</p>
